# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course Name: Computer Science Essentials

Description: Computer Science Essentials is designed to offer an introduction to computer science. Students will learn the basics of computer programming along with the basics of computer science. The material emphasizes computational thinking and helps develop the ability to solve complex problems. This course covers the basic building blocks of programming along with other central elements of computer sicence. It gives a foundation in the tools used in computer science and prepares students for further study in computer science, including AP Computer Science. This course allows students to work independently in text-based Python.

Grade Level: 9-12th

### Situation

All students will be provided with a 1-to-1 Acer C7 Chromebook that they must bring to school every day. Students are to take the chromebooks home at night. There is a separate student wifi that students will use while on campus. Because of the various socioeconomic demographics, some students will have access to wifi at home and other students will not. The typical class size will be about 40 students and 1 teacher. The only exception is if there are special education students. In this case, there will be 2 teachers (1 general education teacher and 1 special education teacher). In some special education cases, students may be using iPads instead of Chromebooks. Each teacher will be provided a Lenovo Thinkpad that they can project through HDMI or VGA cables to a projector or smart board at the front of the classroom.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

*Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.*

Students will use google classroom to have access to materials and links that are posted by the teacher. This is also where they will submit assignments for a grade by posting links to their projects. After evaluating students' levels, the teacher may decide to introduce basic block coding so students get an introduction into computer science by using the software called Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu). Once students have a better foundation, they will use Replit (https://replit.com/) to learn the Python language. This software also allows for student collaboration and can be used for individual as well as group projects. All websites can be access via the internet and are high school ageappropraite.

### Hardware Specifications

*Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.*

Students will be provided with an Acer C7 Chromebook with Chromium OS, Intel Celeron Processor 1.4 GHz, 2GB RAM, and 100 GB of Google Drive Cloud Storage with 16 GB SSD. Students will connect to the school's student wifi to access the internet, although the chromebook will have a dedicated ethernet port.

### Application: To be completed for final exam

*Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.*

### Impacts: To be completed for final exam

*How will the technology help all students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.*
