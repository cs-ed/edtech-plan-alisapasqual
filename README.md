# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course Name: Computer Science Essentials

Description: Computer Science Essentials is designed to offer an introduction to computer science. Students will learn the basics of computer programming along with the basics of computer science. The material emphasizes computational thinking and helps develop the ability to solve complex problems. This course covers the basic building blocks of programming along with other central elements of computer sicence. It gives a foundation in the tools used in computer science and prepares students for further study in computer science, including AP Computer Science. This course allows students to work independently in text-based Python.

Grade Level: 9-12th

### Situation

All students will be provided with a 1-to-1 Acer C7 Chromebook that they must bring to school every day. Students are to take the chromebooks home at night. There is a separate student wifi that students will use while on campus. Because of the various socioeconomic demographics, some students will have access to wifi at home and other students will not. The typical class size will be about 40 students and 1 teacher. The only exception is if there are special education students. In this case, there will be 2 teachers (1 general education teacher and 1 special education teacher). In some special education cases, students may be using iPads instead of Chromebooks. Each teacher will be provided a Lenovo Thinkpad that they can project through HDMI or VGA cables to a projector or smart board at the front of the classroom.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

*Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.*

Students will use google classroom to have access to materials and links that are posted by the teacher. This is also where they will submit assignments for a grade by posting links to their projects. After evaluating students' levels, the teacher may decide to introduce basic block coding so students get an introduction into computer science by using the software called Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu). Once students have a better foundation, they will use Replit (https://replit.com/) to learn the Python language. This software also allows for student collaboration and can be used for individual as well as group projects. All websites can be access via the internet and are high school age appropraite.

### Hardware Specifications

*Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.*

Students will be each provided with an Acer C7 Chromebook with an 11.6" display, Chromium OS, Intel Celeron Processor 1.4 GHz, 2GB RAM, and 100 GB of Google Drive Cloud Storage with 16 GB SSD. Students will connect to the school's student wifi to access the internet, although the chromebook will have a dedicated ethernet port.

Teachers will be provided with a Lenovo Thinkbook with a 15.6" display, Windows 11 OS, Intel Core i5 Processor 4.4 GHz, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD Storage. Teachers will connect to the school's staff-only wifi to access the internet and will be able to connect to the classroom's front projector or smart board.

### Application

*Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.*

Students will first start completing basic assignments on scratch as an introduction for coding. I will pick assignments that allow for students that have experience with block coding to be more creative while also creating structure to guide students whom it may be their first time coding. This will also help any special education students that need more support. Students will submit assignments on Google Classroom at minimum once a week. The teacher will then provide feedback and comments directly on google classroom. Students will also go back and revise previous projects to enhance them as they learn more skills throughout each week.

About one-third of the way through the semester (or sooner depending on students' levels), students will be introduced to Replit to start coding using the Python language. To encourage student discourse, many of the assignments will be group assignments where students will collaborate on Replit and will submit one assignment per group. To ensure that all students equally participate, students will complete peer feedback forms for each assignment.

A final exam will be given in an on-demand coding format where students will be given a prompt and two hours to create a code that fulfills the prompt's requirements. This will be an individual assignment and no collaboration will be allowed to ensure that the teacher can understand what each student learned individually.

### Impacts

*How will the technology help all students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.*

By having all assignments online, this allows for students to easily make up work if they are absent or go on vacation during the school year. In addition, should we ever have to transition to a fully virtual model, students will be aclimated to each website and should transition seamlessly. Any students that are using an iPad or Tablet may have difficulty typing code, thus I would recommend those students get a keyboard and mouse (hopefully provided by the school). 

By having group assignments, this will increase student discourse as they must discuss how they want to code each assignment together. Higher level students can teacher the lower level students and gain valuable skills as they become the mini teacher in their group. While lower level students can get the support they need without needing the teacher for every question. This will also help the teacher to student ratio which is typically 1:40. The teacher can then focus on helping students/groups that really need the extra support.

With evolving course contexts, I hope to design this course in a way that the assignments are applicable to students' lives. For example, creating video games such as the "Pong Game" and runner-style games. Then students can move to more advanced assignments such as creating a program that can retrieve weather data from an official API and print out a forecast for their home address (or another chosen address). There are endless possibilities when it comes to choosing assignments for students and this course can allow for teacher flexibility once they get to know their students' backgrounds and interests.
